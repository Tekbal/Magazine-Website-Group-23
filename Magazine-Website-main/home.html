                Do you have an iPhone that's compatible with iOS 16? If so, you've probably already
                downloaded the
                latest version of Apple's mobile operating system. Before you dive into all of iOS 16's new
                features,
                however, you should take some time to prime your iPhone to make the most of the update.
                After you upgrade to iOS 16, there are three steps you should absolutely take first. All three should
                improve your iPhone experience. Read on to learn the best way to set up your iPhone for iOS 16.

        <h2 class="head">No. 1. Create a new wallpaper option for your iPhone lock screen</h2>
        <p class="explan">Apple has completely redesigned the lock screen on iOS 16, allowing you to fully customize
            various
            elements, like the date and time, add tiny widgets to let you keep up with the weather and popular news,
            and create multiple wallpaper profiles that you can easily switch to and from.

            And if that sounds appealing, customizing your lock screen should be the first thing that you do after
            installing iOS 16.
            To customize your lock screen, press your finger down anywhere on the screen while it's locked and then
            unlock your device when prompted. Once you do that, a brand-new lock screen interface will appear, where
            you can shuffle through and customize your various lock screen wallpapers.

            If you tap the + button at the bottom right to create a new wallpaper, you can browse through various
            Apple wallpapers, featuring weather and astronomy, emojis and more. A few of these wallpapers contain
            built-in widgets, but you can also just add them later.</p>

        <h3 class="head">No. 2. Set up a Focus profile so that you're not distracted by notifications</h3>
        <p class="explan">Last year Apple introduced Focus, the evolution of Do Not Disturb, which you can configure to
            receive only important notifications and alerts and block everything else out. But the productivity feature
            has been heavily reworked on iOS 16, and it's worth checking out and setting up if you want to reduce
            distractions on your iPhone.

            In Settings, go to Focus and then choose a profile or profiles that you want to configure. Inside a Focus
            profile, you can then choose to receive notifications from certain people and apps, show silenced
            notifications on your lock screen, hide notification badges and make it so that your lock screen and home
            screen wallpapers automatically change when your Focus profile is turned on.

            Additionally, you can schedule when you want your Focus profile to be turned on (when you go to sleep) and
            back off (when you wake up). If you use the Health app, you can retrieve your sleep information to choose an
            adequate schedule for Focus.

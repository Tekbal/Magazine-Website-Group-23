                    <h3>Dell XPS 8950</h3>
                    <p>The best overall desktop PC is the one that will work for the most people, and that's the Dell
                        XPS 8950. It's understated in all the right ways, reasonably priced considering the power you
                        can pack inside, and comes in a variety of configurations to suit work, gaming, or both.
                        Choosing the highest-rated PC isn't easy, but the Dell XPS 8950 gets rid of that issue.</p>

                    <h3>HP Omen 45L</h3>
                    <p>The HP Omen 45L takes what made the Omen 30L so special and expands on it. Just like its smaller
                        sibling, the Omen 45L comes with a tool-less case design that allows you to upgrade any of the
                        components inside. HP likes this design so much, in fact, that it now sells the Omen 45L case on
                        its own.</p>

                    <h3>Apple iMac</h3>
                    <p>Apple is more of a laptop than a desktop brand, but the iMac is an exception. It's a balanced
                        computer that has power where it counts and looks that are unmatched.
                        When it comes to Apple, a portion of the charm lies in the aesthetic. The 24-inch iMac is no
                        exception. Coming in up to seven colors — blue, green, pink, white, yellow, orange, and purple —
                        the iMac offers the ability to choose a look that fits you. It's also shockingly thin, measuring
                        at a mere 11.5mm, making it thinner than any other all-in-one desktop on the market</p>
